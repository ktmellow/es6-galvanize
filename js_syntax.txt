caniuse.com --> es6 a JS update
Babel?
In head of the talk today. Wouldn't use in full scale app but useful for this small project lesson. It's a new syntax that doesn't work in all browsers but most modern versions ok. 
Can use codepen jsfiddle jsbin with Babel if you select es6 as an option. 

const shall never have duplicate name or changed value

let
you can use const and use let inside the block safely without error

native JS now uses ``'s as templating language
backticks represent a string template and $curlies are var wrappers

using ...arrayName aka "spread opertors" for putting arrays in arrays automatically flattens
console.log(...alreadyFlatArray) logs all items without quotes

add default values to name function (a=1, y=2) {console.log(a+y);};
